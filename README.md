# Java-Project
I developed a GUI application in Java for managing tickets of a show .The user can see all shows which are registered at a specific date, he can generate a ticket with a specific number and a specific buyer name . The interface was built with  JavaFX + FXML, and data was stored in a database (I used SQLite).
